                            Nicholas Pet Haven was started by Nicholas Nash when he was only 13. 
                            He is now 19 and has helped rescue so many animals and made some major changes for the dogs and cats. 
                            Please support his efforts as we continue to grow. 
                            Our Adoption House is located at 12903 Hwy 155 South in Tyler  TX. 
                            Come meet our sweet rescued babies available for adoption! 
                            We are open from 10am-2pm, Monday-Saturday. 
                            If you are interested but need to meet at a different time, please contact us at the phone number provided or by messaging us.

                            The stranger officiates the meal.
                            He ran out of money, so he had to stop playing poker.
                            Lets all be unique together until we realise we are all the same.
                            She wrote him a long letter, but he didn't read it.
                            If the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy had babies would they take your teeth and leave chocolate for you?
                            He said he was not there yesterday; however, many people saw him there.
                            I will never be this young again. Ever. Oh damnâ€¦ I just got older.
                            I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.
                            I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated.
                            A glittering gem is not enough.
