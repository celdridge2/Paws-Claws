                            Latom when john is killed. David what are we going to have for breakfast.

                            Don't worry, we'll be ok as long as we stick together.She was too short to see over the fence.
                            The sky is clear; the stars are twinkling.

                            Lets all be unique together until we realise we are all the same.
                            She wrote him a long letter, but he didn't read it.
                            If the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy had babies would they take your teeth and leave chocolate for you?
                            He said he was not there yesterday; however, many people saw him there.
                            I will never be this young again. Ever. Oh damn… I just got older.
                            I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.
                            I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated.
